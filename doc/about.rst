About NepidemiX
===============

NeipdemiX is a software package for simulating complex processes on networks. It was developed by members of the `IMPACT-HIV <http://impact-hiv.irmacs.sfu.ca/home/>`_
group and is published under the modified BSD license.

Background
----------

NepidemiX was originally developed with epidemiological simulations in mind, but is of course general enough for other areas of science where complex network simulations are applied. 
So, while the IMPACT-HIV group mainly uses the software for HIV studies, it is suitable also in a broader context, for example in physics, economy and marketing research, and sociology.

HIV spreads by contact between people, so the structure of the social network may
influence the risk of becoming infected. The important implication of this from a public
health perspective is that network structure has an impact on how fast the virus spreads
and how easily it can be stopped from spreading on a network of connections.

The role of a groupâ€™s network structure on the HIV epidemic can be studied
mathematically and empirically to some extent. However, the complexity of epidemic
dynamics increases rapidly with the size of the network and powerful computer
simulations are required for detailed studies. An important activity is the comparison of
the course of epidemics on alternate network structures. Detailed empirical information
on the structure of networks is rarely available but we can make inferences based on
comparative simulation studies. These then enable us to make predictions about the
potential severity of an epidemic and interventions that are most likely to be successful.

The driving force behind the development of NepidemiX was the requirement for large-
scale simulations of epidemic processes on networks. We also wanted to create a tool
that would enable any researcher to build a network model simulation with relative ease
using a set of software building blocks. Network modeling projects typically require a
substantial investment of time and resources to produce one model for a specific problem.
NepidemiX makes this process more general, thereby simplifying the construction of a
network model for any problem of choice. NepidemiX allows for this through a highly
configurable simulation class, and processes that may be configured using an easy to read
script or implemented in the powerful Python programming language.
