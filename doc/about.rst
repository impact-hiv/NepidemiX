About NepidemiX
===============

NeipdemiX is a software package for simulating complex processes on networks. It was developed by members of the `IMPACT-HIV <http://impact-hiv.irmacs.sfu.ca/home/>`_
group and is published under the modified BSD license.

Background
----------

HIV spread by contact and so the structure and mechanisms of a persons behavioral network may influence the risk potential. Based on
this hypothesis it becomes important to investigate the role of risk
group network structure in a population, not only by analysis and
studies, but also by powerful computer simulations comparing disease
dynamics on many types of networks.
This need has been the driving force behind the development of
NepidemiX. While many network analysis tools exist epidemic modeling
requires general disease processes to be put on the network.

NepidemiX allows for just that with a highly configurable simulation
class, and processes that may be configured using an easy to read
script or implemented in the powerful Python programming language.

While the IMPACT-HIV group mainly uses the software for HIV studies,
it is suitable not only for epidemiology simulations in a broader
context, but can be adopted for general network processes.
